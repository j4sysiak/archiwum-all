How to fix 'System has not been booted with systemd' error?
The simple answer is to not use the systemctl command. Instead, use the equivalent sysvinit command.

It's not too complicated and both commands have somewhat similar syntax.

This table should help you.

Systemd command	              | Sysvinit command
------------------------------+---------------------------------
systemctl start service_name	service service_name start
systemctl stop service_name	    service service_name stop
systemctl restart service_name	service service_name restart
systemctl status service_name	service service_name status
systemctl enable service_name	chkconfig service_name on
systemctl disable service_name	chkconfig service_name off



sudo systemctl status jenkins                sudo jenkins status



==================   file system ================================

Git can be installed on Windows AND on WSL
An important consideration: when you enable WSL and install a Linux distribution, you are installing a new file system, 
separated from the Windows NTFS C:\ drive on your machine. 
In Linux, drives are not given letters. They are given mount points. 
The root of your file system / is the mount point of your root partition, or folder, in the case of WSL. 
Not everything under / is the same drive. For example, on my laptop, 
I've installed two version of Ubuntu (20.04 and 18.04), as well as Debian. 
If I open those distributions, select the home directory with the command cd ~, and then enter the command explorer.exe ., 
Windows File Explorer will open and show me the directory path for that distribution.

Linux distro	Windows Path to access home folder
Ubuntu 20.04	\\wsl$\Ubuntu-20.04\home\jacek

====================   inatalacja Git =================

Installing Git
Git comes already installed with most of the Windows Subsystem for Linux distributions, however, you may want to update to the latest version. You also will need to set up your git config file.

To install Git, see the Git Download for Linux site. Each Linux distribution has their own package manager and install command.

For the latest stable Git version in Ubuntu/Debian, enter the command:

Bash

 
root@BERLIN:/# sudo apt-get install git

root@BERLIN:/# git --version
git version 2.25.1

root@BERLIN:/# git config --global user.name "j4sysiak"
root@BERLIN:/# git config --global user.email "j4sysiak@gmail.com"

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Ensure the distribution runs in WSL 2 mode. WSL can run distributions in both v1 or v2 mode.

To check the WSL mode, run (inwindows CMD):
PS C:\Users\Jacek> wsl.exe -l -v
  NAME                   STATE           VERSION
* docker-desktop-data    Running         2
  Ubuntu-20.04           Running         1
  docker-desktop         Running         2
  
  PS C:\Users\Jacek> 
  
PS C:\Users\Jacek> wsl.exe --set-version Ubuntu-20.04 2

To confirm that Docker has been installed, open a WSL distribution (e.g. Ubuntu) and display 
the version and build number by entering: 
root@BERLIN:/# docker --version
Docker version 20.10.17, build 100c701

Test that your installation works correctly by running a simple built-in Docker image using: 
root@BERLIN:/# docker run hello-world
root@BERLIN:/# docker run -it ubuntu bash

jacek@BERLIN:~$ docker image ls --all

=================   Install MySQL
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-database

Install MySQL
To install MySQL on WSL (ie. Ubuntu):

Open your WSL terminal (ie. Ubuntu).
Update your Ubuntu packages: sudo apt update
Once the packages have updated, install MySQL with: sudo apt install mysql-server
Confirm installation and get the version number: mysql --version
You may also want to run the included security script. This changes some of the less secure default options for things like remote root logins and sample users. To run the security script:

Start a MySQL server: sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
Start the security script prompts: sudo mysql_secure_installation
The first prompt will ask whether you’d like to set up the Validate Password Plugin, which can be used to test the strength of your MySQL password. You will then set a password for the MySQL root user, decide whether or not to remove anonymous users, decide whether to allow the root user to login both locally and remotely, decide whether to remove the test database, and, lastly, decide whether to reload the privilege tables immediately.
To open the MySQL prompt, enter: sudo mysql

To see what databases you have available, in the MySQL prompt, enter: SHOW DATABASES;

To create a new database, enter: CREATE DATABASE database_name;

To delete a database, enter: DROP DATABASE database_name;

For more about working with MySQL databases, see the MySQL docs.

To work with with MySQL databases in VS Code, try the MySQL extension.
