-------------------------------------------------------------------


Prerequisites
The instructions assume that you are logged in as root or user with sudo privileges .

Installing OpenJDK
Gradle requires Java SE 8 or later to be installed on the machine.

Enter the following commands to install OpenJDK 11 :

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
CopyCopy
Verify the Java installation by printing the Java version :

java -version
Copy
The output should look something like this:

openjdk version "11.0.7" 2020-04-14
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.7+10-post-Ubuntu-3ubuntu1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.7+10-post-Ubuntu-3ubuntu1, mixed mode, sharing)
Copy
Downloading Gradle
At the time of writing this article, the latest version of Gradle is 6.5.1. Before continuing with the next step, check the Gradle releases page to see if a newer version is available.

Downloading the Gradle binary-only zip file in the /tmp directory using the following wget command:

VERSION=6.5.1
wget https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-${VERSION}-bin.zip -P /tmp
CopyCopy
Once the download is completed, unzip the file in the /opt/gradle directory:

sudo unzip -d /opt/gradle /tmp/gradle-${VERSION}-bin.zip
Copy
If you get an error saying “sudo: unzip: command not found”, install the unzip package with sudo apt install unzip.
Gradle is regularly updated with security patches and new features. To have more control over versions and updates, we’ll create a symbolic link named latest, which points to the Gradle installation directory:

sudo ln -s /opt/gradle/gradle-${VERSION} /opt/gradle/latest
Copy
Later, when upgrading Gradle, unpack the newer version and change the symlink to point to it.

Setting up the Environment Variables
We need to add the Gradle bin directory to the system PATH environment variable. To do so, open your text editor and create a new file named gradle.sh inside of the /etc/profile.d/ directory.

sudo nano /etc/profile.d/gradle.sh
Copy
Paste the following configuration:

/etc/profile.d/gradle.sh
export GRADLE_HOME=/opt/gradle/latest
export PATH=${GRADLE_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
Copy
Save and close the file. This script will be sourced at shell startup.

Make the script executable :

sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/gradle.sh
Copy
Load the environment variables in the current shell session using the source command:

source /etc/profile.d/gradle.sh
Copy
Verifying the Gradle Installation
To validate that Gradle is installed properly use the gradle -v command which will display the Gradle version:

gradle -v
Copy
You should see something like the following:

Welcome to Gradle 6.5.1!

Here are the highlights of this release:
 - Experimental file-system watching
 - Improved version ordering
 - New samples
